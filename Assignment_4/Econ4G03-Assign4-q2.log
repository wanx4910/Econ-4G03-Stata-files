. * Part b
. * OLS regression done in a would be inappropriate to estimate the causal effect
. * of fertility and it is because we don't have ordinal information of the causal

. * Couples whose first 2 children are of the same sex are more likely to have a 
. * third child. As you are 6.75% more likely to have a third child if your first
. * two children are the same sex. the effect is somewhat large as it is 
. * statistically significant and different from zero.
. * Part d
. * Samesex is a valid instrument for an IV regression of weeksworked on morekids
. * because the sex of your children should be random and it should not affect 
. * your labour supply differently whether they are the same sex or not.
. * Therefore it grabs the variation in X as shown in part c but should not 
. * directly correlated with labour supply. 
. * Part e
. * samesex is not a weak instrument because the F-stat is >> 10, this shows that
. * it is well correlated with whether you have more than 2 kids.

. * The results change numerically, because the additional regressors serve as 
. * control variables so they grab the some of the variance of Y however, the
. * causal effect of fertility on labour supply remains robust as the results do
. * not change directions or vary significantly in magnitude. Therefore the 
. * results in part g are more precise compared to part f.
